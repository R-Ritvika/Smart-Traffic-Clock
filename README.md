# Smart-Traffic-Clock
This project encompasses designing, developing, and implementing a smart traffic display system that is integrated into a functional wall clock. 
The main objective is to develop a device that is easy to use, shows real-time traffic conditions with RGB LEDs, and offers audio updates for accessibility. The system is designed for use in the workplace and will aid employees in making informed choices about their commutes. The primary elements and activities encompassed by the project scope are:
1.
Hardware Integration
•
Creating a custom digital clock case for the system.
•
Incorporating RGB LEDs onto the clock face to show traffic status visually.
•
Incorporating a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) to manage LED behavior.
•
Linking a speaker or audio module for oral traffic announcements.
2.
Software Integration
•
Developing code that extracts real-time traffic information from an API (such as Google Maps).
•
Coding the logic for turning traffic data into LED signals (green, yellow, red).
•
Incorporating text-to-speech (TTS) or pre-recorded audio features for traffic updates.
•
Guaranteeing real-time data updates and seamless system functioning.
3.
User interface and Accessibility
•
Making sure that the LED indicators are easy to see and can be understood intuitively.
•
Timely and precise audio feedback, which is clear, for users with visual impairments.
•
Creating a clock that is attractive and appropriate for office settings.
4.
Testing and evaluation
•
Conducting unit and integration tests of hardware and software components.
•
Evaluating the precision and responsiveness of real-time traffic data.
•
Collecting opinions regarding usability and accessibility.
5.
Documentation
•
Recording hardware installation, wiring, and configuration.
•
Creating user and technical documentation for future maintenance or enhancements.
